# Odin_Landing_Page

## Project Overview

This project is a part of **The Odin Project - Foundations Course** and this is my first larger project using **HTML** and **CSS**.
The goal of the project was building a complete landing web page using HTML and CSS from scratch, with the use of **Flexbox** as the central layout tool.

The imporant lesson:

- Structure
- Correct Spacing
- Alignment
- Readability
- Reusable Layout Patters

## What I Built

I implemented a full, 4-section landing page:

1. A header with navigation.
2. A hero section with text and media.
3. An information section using reusable cards.
4. A quote section.
5. A Call-To-Action section.
6. A footer section for copyright.

All these sections in the layout use flexbox behaviour, like flex-direction and so on.

## Techonologies Used

- HTML5
  - Header, nav, section, ...
- CSS3
  - Flexbox.
  - Reusable components (cards, buttons).
- Git and GitHub
  - Good commits in a timely manner.

## Key Learning Outcomes

Through this small to medium sized project, I learned:

- How to structure a real web page with HTML.
- How to style the web page using CSS and flex:
  - Aligning items horizontal/vertical.
  - Creating responsive layouts, depending on screen and other settings.
  - Reusable code.
- Learned how to break a web page into various smaller segments and components and how to build it myself.
- Debugging CSS issues and weird behaviour, that do not make sense.

This project improved my confidence in using HTML and CSS, but it also showed me that there is still much to learn.

## Notes and Reflections

This was the first larger project i did from the small HTML and CSS exercises I have done while reading documentation. It made me realise that the "easy" things i had read and learned, was not possible to actively recall while solving the problems in this project. I had to search fundamental things and how to use them where and when.
The most frustrating part of this project was that the CSS blocks I made, would alter unforeseen places in the web page. Additionally, when adressing a issue with align-text: center;, it would "Rock" a lot of other things around. The solution was often to just add other things like justify-content or flex direction, but even with that it is still not entirely clear to my why that happens.
So to conclude, the challenge was interaction between the different components.

## Status

**Completed**

This project serves as a foundation for future work regarding CSS, HTML and the JavaScript projects that I will be implementing.
